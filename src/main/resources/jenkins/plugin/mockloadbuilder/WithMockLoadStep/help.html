        Generates load on the Jenkins build node and over the remoting channel. There will be a random number of build
        artifacts created matching the file name pattern <code>mock-artifact-*.txt</code>. There will be a JUnit test
        report with the file name <code>mock-junit.xml</code>. Approximately 5% of the time, the build will "fail" its
        tests and thus no artifacts will be generated unless <code>testFailureIgnore</code> was specified.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the <code>mockLoad</code> step, this step does not itself run the load command.
        Instead, it copies the program into the workspace and prepares a command for you to run yourself.
        Usage:
    </p>
    <pre><code>withMockLoad(averageDuration: 300, testFailureIgnore: true) {
  sh MOCK_LOAD_COMMAND
}
junit 'mock-junit.xml'
archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'mock-artifact-*.txt', fingerprint: true</code></pre>
